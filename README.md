# Control Drawdown, Maximize Returns

This project explores the intersection of portfolio optimization, risk management, and machine learning using Python. It aims to minimize drawdowns while maximizing returnsâ€”mirroring the kinds of risk-reward decisions made at trading firms.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Does

- ðŸ“‰ **Drawdown Control**: Analyze and limit portfolio drawdown through statistical constraints
- ðŸ’¼ **Portfolio Optimization**: Use `PyPortfolioOpt` to build efficient portfolios under custom risk limits
- ðŸŽ² **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Simulate various market scenarios to test portfolio robustness
- ðŸ§  **Machine Learning for Returns Prediction**: Apply regression models to forecast expected returns
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization & Reporting**: Clean charts for returns, drawdowns, risk exposure

## ðŸ“š Tech Stack

- `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Statsmodels`
- `PyPortfolioOpt` â€“ portfolio optimization
- `Scikit-Learn` â€“ machine learning
- `Seaborn` â€“ for clean visualizations

## ðŸš€ Why I Built This

As someone passionate about financial markets, I wanted to explore the quantitative side of risk. This project helped me better understand how prop firms think about balancing return and volatilityâ€”especially under extreme conditions.

## ðŸ”­ Next Steps

- Add Sharpe Ratio constraints
- Extend to factor models (e.g. Fama-French)
- Deploy as a Streamlit app
- Apply stress testing from historical events (2008, COVID crash, etc.)

## ðŸ’¡ Connect With Me

If you work at the intersection of trading, risk, and Pythonâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts or collaborate on the next iteration of this.
